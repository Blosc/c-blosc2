## What is it?

Blosc2 is a high-performance data container optimized for binary data.
Blosc2 is the next generation of Blosc, an [award-winning]
(https://www.blosc.org/posts/prize-push-Blosc2)` library that has been
around for more than a decade.

Blosc2 expands the capabilities of Blosc by providing a higher lever
container that is able to store many chunks on it (hence the super-block name).
It supports storing data on both memory and disk using the same API.
Also, it adds more compressors and filters.
